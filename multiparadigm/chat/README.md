Empty your mind. Be formless. Shapeless. Like Lisp.

You pour Lisp into a functional paradigm, it becomes the functional paradigm.
You pour Lisp into a procedural paradigm, it becomes the procedural paradigm.
You pour Lisp into an object-oriented paradigm, it becomes the object-oriented
paradigm.

Lisp can flow, or it can crash.

Be Lisp, my friend.
